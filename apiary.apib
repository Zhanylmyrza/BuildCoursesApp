# BuildCoursesApp

I just implemented a simple *REST API* for **building courses** using [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) and
[Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) with
[PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/) . 
Used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test all request

**Note:** By the way, don't also forget to view the
[Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zhanylmyrza/BuildCoursesApp/main/apiary.apib)
code to see what is really going on in the ***API Blueprint***, as opposed to just
seeing the output of the Github Markdown parser.

## Built With
* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) - A high-level Python web framework
* [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - The rest framework used
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of my project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

First of all, you need to have one code editor. In my case, it is a 
[**Visual Studio Code editor**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Also, I recomend you to install 
[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/),
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/),
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) on your laptop, 
if you want to do everything as same as mine.
Actually, the django project connected with database colled **SQLite** by default. 
You can keep it, as it was. 
For that case, I recommend you to install
[SQLiteStudio(3.4.3)](https://sqlitestudio.pl/).
As saying goes, the *Postman* also just for testing...
```

On commend prompt of your project or straight away in the terminal of your project write:

py -m pip istall Django

but, as in my project everything installed already
you just need to download my project
by clicking on the green button in the right corner

```

### Let's start

After downloding my project, write in terminal: 

```

python manage.py runserver

```
And enjoy the process of coding and learning :D
